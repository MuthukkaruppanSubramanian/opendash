# The Open Dashboard Project

This is an open source personal dashboard written on the [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) web framework. A working version is hosted by [ZUMH](http://zumh.org) at [https://dash.zumh.org](https://dash.zumh.org). I hope this project will grow and prosper as time goes on. Also I hope someone finds this somewhat beneficial, besides myself of course.
