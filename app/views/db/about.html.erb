  	<h3 class="text-left">Background</h3>
  	<p class="text-left">The Open Dashboard project was started in 2014 by <%= link_to "ZUMH", "http://zumh.org" %>. It was originally intended to be a quick and easy way to see the date &amp; time. From that it has grown to include the weather, news &amp; stocks; as well as allowing much more customization than the original. The main emphasis is that this project is completely open source to everyone! You can find us on <i class='fa fa-fw fa-github'></i><%= link_to "GitHub", "https://github.com/tizz98/opendash" %> and look below to see the number of dashboards created with this website!</p><br>
